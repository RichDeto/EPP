## Inputs

This report present the coverage evaluation of `r nrow(centers)` centers, and the coverage of `r nrow(pop)` individuals with a `r mean(pop$weight)` mean of `r var_of_weight`.

## Outputs

```{r}
set.seed(1)
exist <- eppexist(pop = pop, centers = centers, crs = crs)
```

The population how may be out of coverage are `r nrow(exist$pop_uncover)` with a `r mean(exist$pop_uncover$weight)` mean of `r var_of_weight`.

The population assigned to the corresponding center are `r nrow(exist$pop_assigned)` with a `r mean(exist$pop_assigned$weight)` mean of `r var_of_weight`.

```{r}
ggplot(exist$pop_assigned, aes(x = id, y = weight, color = it)) + 
    geom_point(size = 6)
```

From the point of the centers, let's look at the unused capacity after processing, to evaluate which centers need to be analyzed for excess supply of quotas.

```{r}
ggplot(exist$remaining_capacity, aes(x = id, y = capacity)) + 
    geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```
