Evaluation of Proximity Programs

This is our first attempt to transform a R syntax applied to a case in evaluation for an initial education program in Uruguay,
which gave us interesting results, and we wanted to share the methodology used, in a R package format. 
Obviously all contributions are welcome, even though we are still in the process of polishing.
