\title{Calculate Voronoi polygons for a set of points}
\usage{
voro_polygon(x, bounding.polygon = NULL, range.expand = 0.1)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{SpatialPoints} or \code{SpatialPointsDataFrame} object}

\item{bounding.polygon}{If present, this is a \code{SpatialPolygons*} object specifying the 
bounding polygon(s) for the Voronoi polygons.  If present, the 
Voronoi polygons are clipped to the outside 
bounding polygon of \code{bounding.polygon}.  The outside bounding polygon
is the union of all polygons 
in \code{bounding.polygon}.  If this is not present, the Voronoi polygons
extend to a rectangle that is \code{range.expand} beyond the 
bounding box of input points in all directions.}

\item{range.expand}{A length-one or length-two vector of expansion 
factors for the bounding box 
of points in \code{x} in the horizontal and vertical directions. If length 
one, it is replicated to length two.  Element one is the fraction of the 
bounding box's horizontal width that is added and subtracted to the 
horizontal extent 
of the output polygons. Element two is the fraction of the 
bounding box's vertical height that is added and subtracted to the vertical extent 
of the output polygons.  Only this parameter's 
absolute value is used (i.e., all values are made positive). If
\code{bounding.polygon} is present, this parameter is ignored.}
}
\value{
A \code{SpatialPolygonsDataFrame} containing the Voronoi polygons
 (or tessellations) surrounding the points in \code{x}. Attributes of the 
 output polygons are: 
 \itemize{
   \item x : the horizontal coordinate of the tessellation's defining point
   \item y : the vertical coordinate of the tessellation's defining point
   \item area : area of tessellation, in units of \code{x}'s projection.
 }
}
\description{
Calculate Voronoi polygons (or tessellations) from a 
 \code{SpatialPoints*} object
}
\details{
This is a convenience routine for the 
\code{deldir::deldir} function.  The hard work, computing the Voronoi polygons,
is done by the \code{deldir::deldir} and \code{deldir::tile.list} functions. 
See documentation for those functions for details of computations.

This function is convenient because it takes a \code{SpatialPoints*} 
object and returns a \code{SpatialPolygonsDataFrame} object.

\examples{
x <- sp::SpatialPoints(centers_epp[ ,1:2])
centers_voro <- voro_polygon(x)
